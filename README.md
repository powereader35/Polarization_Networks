# Quantifying Twitter Polarization with Network Science
<!-- badges: start -->

![lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Experimental-orange?style=flat)

This project aims to **measure and interpret political polarization** in large-scale social media networks using **network science** and **tweet-level analysis**. By constructing user interaction graphs and analyzing  clustering, we explore how the network behaves and impacts polarization.

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project investigates:
- To what extent political ideology influences interactions.
- Whether users tend to form echo chambers.
- How polarization is impacted over time.

We use techniques such as:
- Network construction from user interactions.
- Cross-party behavior visualization.
- Modularity-based community detection.
- Ideological assortativity metrics.
